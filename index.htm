				<h2>We are trying to implement a new way of doing potions.

				<h2>If you would like the alchemist to make potions with your materials (including vials), please send the mats with an attached message of what you would like made via in-game mail. The potions will be crafted and mailed back to you with a 5s CoD.
				<br />
				<br />
				<h2>If you would like to purchase potions from the Guild Store, please submit a ticket through discord. One of the alchemists will fill your request and CoD you the potions at the listed price.

				<i>*The potions from the Guild Store are intended for use in the raids, not for resale purposes.</i>
